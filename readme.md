# 3D from scratch

Using the p5js API for interaction and 2D drawing commands to make a 3D engine "from scratch."

## Project Goals

- A reasonable suite of graphics primitives (rectangular prism, plane, sphere, etc.)
- Basic physics simulation of 3D bodies
- 3D collision detection for convex polyhedra
- Impulse based collision resolution
- Texture rendering on faces and other basic graphics strategies
- Shading and basic lighting techniques
- Attempt to design a good API for using my project

## Learning Goals

- Increased experience with linear algebra and differential equation topics used for physics integration and vector manipulation
- Basic knowledge about 2D and 3D graphics techniques like texture drawing, shading, and lighting
- Build project management skills
